**RMAC Baseball Voting**

This project is an analysis on the methods and decision making processes Rocky Mountain Athletic Baseball Coaches make when choosing  Gold Glove winners.  The purpose is to analyze and discover voting patterns on coaches voting. Some analysis goals are to determine whether RMAC Baseball Coach's vote purely on statistical metrics, or players are voted on due to a subjective judgment based on coaches who have evaluated a playerâ€™s statistical performance and immeasurable tangibles, such as character, attitude, effort, and/or competitiveness.  

**Data Collection**

<p align="center"> Defensive Stats Data

Information from 2013-2017 including 1,263 players and 18 features (4 categorical, 13 numerical, 1 target):

**e:** Errors 

**fp:** Fielding Percentage 

**dp:** Double Plays 

**sba:** Stolen Base Attempts 

**csb:** Caught Stealing Base 

**sbap:** Stolen Base Achieved Percentage

**GoldGlove:** Yes or No, Target Variable, Player wins Defensive award for their position or not (45 winners, 9/year, one winner for each position each year (4 INF/year, 3 OF/year), *Note: Some years there are ties)

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
	
Majority of the data organizing was performed in Excel.  Data handling was dealt with in R.  I performed Exploratory Data Analysis Visualizations to see visual comparisons of statistics between Gold Glove winners and losers.  Below is a Visualization Comparison for each set of positions.

**Model Analysis**

The Defensive Stats Dataset is a binary classification problem, which a combination of descriptive and numerical statistics can predict whether or not a player will win a Gold Glove.  Since the 5 years of data collected already has the target variable known, I performed 4 different classification supervised learning algorithms.  Decision Tree and Random Forest both gave me a strong accuracy of the balanced dataset which contains 630 Winners and 585 Losers.  I performed and compared a regular, linear, and polynomial svm model against one another.  Lastly, I executed a k-nearest neighbors algorithm on the balanced dataset with k = 2, 5, 8, 15.

<p align="center"> Decision Tree

Accuracy = 90%

Variable Importance Order:

1.) Chances

2.) Putouts 

3.) Double Plays 

4.) Fielding Percentage 

5.) Assists 

6.) Team 

7.) Errors 

8.) Conference Standing 

9.) Year 

10.) Caught Stealing Base 

11.) Stolen Base Attempt Percentage

12.) Position 

13.) Grade 

14.) Stolen Base Attempts 

15.) Passed Balls 

16.) Catchers Interference

**Conclusions/Interpretation of Results**

After reviewing all of the supervised learning algorithm accuracy results, I can conclude that the random forest method produces the highest accuracy rate of 96%.

Since random forest had the highest accuracy rate, I chose to do further exploratory data analysis to narrow down the players who were in the running for awards or perhaps should have won an award based on variable importance. My filtering and analysis consists of players who did not win Gold Gloves but meet the requirements of the 1st quartile of data in the top 5 variables of importance from the random forest model.  I took the first quartile values of Gold Glove winners in chances, putouts, double plays, and assists.  I took the third quartile for errors from Gold Glove winners since less errors is better.  By taking players who did not win Gold Gloves, and who meet these 5 requirements are the top candidates for winning a Gold Glove.  These candidates could have been selected as Gold Glove Winners for their respective positions and years.  The final decision was based on coach's judgment.

After viewing the results of my analysis we can conclude what important factors dictate the winners.  Before performing this analysis, I assumed fielding percentage and Conference Standing would be more important variables in deciding who wins a Gold Glove.  Through personal experience it seems that the better teams would have more award winners because of better players and more wins.  However, coaches have done a good job on voting on players who perform well purely on statistics (which in my opinion is more morally correct).  With these results I am looking forward to predicting this year's Gold Glove winners after the season in May knowing which variables to analyze.  To summarize the analysis and findings simply, players have the best chance of winning a Gold Glove if they play more than anyone else and have the most chances of touching the baseball.  It gives them more opportunities for putouts, double plays, and assists.  All of these variables are very important in dictating winners.
