**RMAC Baseball Voting**

This project is an analysis on the methods and decision making processes Rocky Mountain Athletic Baseball Coaches make when choosing  Gold Glove winners.  The purpose is to analyze and discover voting patterns on coaches voting. Some analysis goals are to determine whether RMAC Baseball Coach's vote purely on statistical metrics, or players are voted on due to a subjective judgment based on coaches who have evaluated a playerâ€™s statistical performance and immeasurable tangibles, such as character, attitude, effort, and/or competitiveness.
