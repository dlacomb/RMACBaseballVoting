RMACBaseballVoting is an analysis on the methods and decision making processes Rocky Mountain Athletic Baseball Coaches make when choosing All-Conference and Gold Glove winners.  The purpose of this project is to analyze and discover if there is enough evidence to determine whether RMAC Baseball Coach's vote purely on statistical metrics, or is there enough evidence to prove that players are voted on due to a subjective judgment based on coaches who have evaluated a player’s statistical performance and immeasurable tangibles, such as character, attitude, effort, and/or competitiveness.  Within the analysis, all-conference winners will be decided based on statistical performance and will be analyzed against the winner of that year.
